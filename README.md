# Surfs_up Analysis

## Overview
We are analyzing temperature trends over the last handful of years in Oahu for the months of June and December. These months are exactly 6 months apart and at the end of Spring and Fall respectively. The goal of our analysis is to determine our surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
There are 3 major differences we want to point out in weather between June and December
* The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees while in December it's over 3 degrees colder at 71.04
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees while in December it's down to 56 degrees
* The 25th percentile in June is 73 degreed while in December it drops to 69 degrees

## Summary
All in all, we find that the temperatures in both June and December would keep our surf and ice cream shop business busy. With temperatures above 71 degrees over 62% of the time, this will allow for surfing and the desire for ice cream. Personally, as long as it's a day of the week ending in Y, I could go for any ice cream at any time! 

Two additonal queries we'd like to preform to gather more information on weather data in June and December would be the following:
1. Temperatures based on the amount of rain for the day
2. Temperatures based on the time of day the temperature reading is collected
